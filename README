Tennis Game Kata with Python
http://python-mock.sourceforge.net/
https://github.com/bebraw/speccer

Scriptable Simulator included

The idea is to implement tennisgame.spec and tennisgame.py.
The goal is scoring logic for tennis game.

Simulator can be used to visualize progress, but for it to work
there's some assumptions. Check simulator.py and Presenter Class.

Example implementation is in example folder. Copy to same folder
as simulator to try it out.

Use "run_specs" to run unit tests. Python mock is also needed.
